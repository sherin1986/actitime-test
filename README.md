## actitime test

actiTIME is a web timesheet software. It allows you to enter time spent on different work assignments, register time offs and sick leaves, and then create detailed reports covering almost any management or accounting needs.

This project aims at testing actitime using Selenium Webdriver with scripting language Java. It now covers testcases for creating customers and projects as well as creating tasks for each project.
